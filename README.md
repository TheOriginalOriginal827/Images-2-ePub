# Images-2-ePub 🖼️->📘
A converter to take a collection of images and convert them to the ePub file format (eBooks). This converter takes compatable image files and user-provided metadata, and creates a corresponding ePub file out of it. This program is mainly meant for graphic novels, comics, manga and the like. 
<br/><br/>
### Requirements
  Python (most newer versions will likely work)
  Pillow (most newer versions will likely work)
<br/><br/>
### IMAGES MUST BE IN CORRECT FORMAT!
Images must be formated as so: <br/>
'img_1.png'<br/>
'img_2.jpeg'<br/>
'img_3.gif'<br/>

### Have any problems?<br/>
If you have any issues regarding a generated ePub file and/or a reader, please submit an issue for me to look into it! I want to make this program as accessible and universal as I can, however I can only do so much by myself. So please, if you have any issues, submit and issue, or contact me at thepegning@gmail.com
